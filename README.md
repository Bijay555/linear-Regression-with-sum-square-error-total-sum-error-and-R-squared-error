This file consist of linear regression code with feature selection through correlation matrix and determine coefficient of regression.
Feature selection is one of the first and important steps while performing any machine learning task. A feature in case of a dataset simply means a column. When we get any dataset, not necessarily every column (feature) is going to have an impact on the output variable. If we add these irrelevant features in the model, it will just make the model worst (Garbage In Garbage Out). This gives rise to the need of doing feature selection.
Also determine the difference in predicted output from original output. This determine how perfectly the lines are fitted with the datasets.
